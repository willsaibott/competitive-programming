I think the term "survival of the fittest" is commonly percepted in a somewhat
wrong way. As the description of question 3 of this week's discussion topics
implies it does not necessarily apply only to the individual organism. Rather
there are abundant examples of collectivism in nature of which I want to give
just two examples:
****END_OF_TEXT****
1) Colonies of state-building insects, e.g. ants, bees, wasps:
These kind of species have a lot of highly specialized invidual members which
perform tasks within the division of labour which are clearly not to their
personal benefit but to that of the community as a whole. That behaviour is
called "eusocial". Because typically only one of the many members actually
reproduces (the "queen") there is obviously no way that the workers can give
their genes to the next generation themselves. However they perform important
tasks in nest building, food aquisition, care for the queen's offspring,
defence against intruders and so on which benefit the queen's offspring and
in that way also their own genes which are shared with the queen's. [1] [2]

2) Humans:
Humans have developed a number of traits which enable them to survive as a
group much better than they would do without these traits. The most important
one in my view is language, i.e. the ability to communicate in abstract terms.
This enabled Homo Sapiens to build increasingly sophisticated societies with
ever-increasing technological achievements which in turn made them populate
basically the entire world (it's surface, at least) in the last 50.000 to
100.000 years on the expense of other Homo species and lot's of non-Homo
species as well. To achieve this, a high level of cooperation is needed with
individual members often showing altruistic behaviour not only in supporting
their next of kin but also strangers, i.e. society as a whole. This works
even when some individuals clearly act in selfish ways as long as they are
in a relatively small minority. So in evolutionary terms Homo Sapiens had
some very successful tens of thousands of years lately. Of course, the moral
implications of making a lot of other species getting distinct in the process
are an altogether different thing which evolution doesn't stress itself with.

The question how an increase or decrease in the frequency of meteor
impacts might have affected the evolutionary history of Earth is very
fascinating. I will try to formulate some speculations on it:

In general I think a catastrophic impact event works as a kind of "reset
button" for the Earth's biosphere. Many habitats are destroyed, new habitats
are created. So while obviously a lot of harm is done in the way of individual
anmials dying and species becoming extinct a lot of good is done also in
creating new possibilities for life to evolve. So evolution in a way gets a
chance to try something new after possibly having run into "dead ends" for
some existing concepts.

Increase in impact frequency:

This would mean more "resets", i.e. more chances for new species but also
less time for existing species to evolve sophisticated life-styles perfectly
tuned to their environments. So I think we would see more different
evolutinonary concepts but with lesser sophistication for each. Assuming that
"we" (i.e. humans) would exist in the first place.

Decrease in impact frequency:
Conversely to the argument made above for the "increase scenario" this would
probably mean more time for species to evolve ever more perfectly to their
environments but with less chance and also less need for evolution to come
up with new solutions for new problems. So I would expect a less diverse
biosphere then. For us (humans) as a species it could for example mean that
the dinosaurs never became extinct and so mammals would continue to be an
insignificant niche species which would not evolve into the dominant lineag
e it is today. So maybe no humans at all.

There is a lot of evidence that in the early history of Earth a lot more
impact events happened than in the last billion years or so, i.e. the frequency
used to be much higher [1]. So in the early stages of life on Earth it had to
cope with a high impact frequency. On the other hand it is currently believed
that the water which exists on Earth today and which plays a huge role in the
origin and evolution of life on Earth was delivered by Asteroid impacts on the
young Earth [2] [3]. So without these life on Earth may never have been even
started.
